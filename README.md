# PythonWorkTimerDB

This project constructs a countdown timer that, upon completion, will insert metadata into a database about the work you've done.

You can select how many minutes you want the timer to be, an mp3 file as an alarm, and what comments you have about each work session.

Note:
Make sure to change the path to the mp3 (PyTimer line 36) and path to where you want the database (PyDB line 10).


Here is an example of output from prior use
